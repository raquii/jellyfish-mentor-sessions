# Jellyfish CTD RoR Course

## Week 3 - March 26 2025

- Active Record Associations
  - Types of Associations
    - **One-to-Many** Relationship: `belongs_to` and `has_many`
    - **One-to-One** Relationship: `belongs_to` and `has_one`
      - Drivers License â†’ Person
    - **Many-to-Many** Relationship: `has_many :through` and `has_many`
      - Using a *join* (aka *association*, aka *relational*) *table* to create a Many-to-Many relationship
      - Teachers and Students, with a `students_teachers` join table
      - Doctors and Patients (Appointments as the join table)
    - [Polymorphic Relationships](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations)
  - Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
    - ActiveRecord generates a lot of methods for us to interact with our objects without us having to define those methods
- **Active Record Migrations**
  - `bin/rails db:migrate`
  - `bin/rails db:rollback`
  - `bin/rails generate [migration | model | scaffold] ...`
  - 
- **Object Oriented Programming**
  - Building Blocks of Object-Oriented Programming
    - **Abstraction** - Take complex process and reduce it to a simple interface
    - **Polymorphism** - Allowing objects to behave differently based on their context, allowing classes to be treated as objects of a common type.
    - **Inheritance** - Child class can interit methods and properties from its parent
    - **Encapsulation** - Restricting direct access to an objects properties (getters/setters) and bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.

## Week 2 - March 19 2025

- `!` `?` Methods
  - Ruby has special naming convention for certain methods
  - If a method ends in an `!` it means it is "destructive" or it raises so error
    - In active record world, `!` methods raise errors when things go wrong
      - `save` will fail silently, `save!` will raise an error
  - If a method ends in a `?`, it means the return of the method is a boolean
    - `#active?` it will return `true` or `false` depending on if the instance is `active`
- Classes and Instances: Review
  - A *Class* is a blueprint
    - A class is a table in the database
  - An *instance*, or an *object*, is a class realized
    - An instance is a row in the table in the database
- Relationship modeling
  - relationship describe the **cardinality** (numerical relationship) between the rows of one table and the rows of another
    - the cardinality between objects/instances
    - Entity-Relationships, modeled visually as ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagrams)
  - `belongs_to` (one-to-many)
  - `has_many` (one-to-many) inverse of `belongs_to`
- SQL
  - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language for maintaining and managing data in a database
  - SQL can be used with a variety of Database Systems (sqlite, MySQL, Postgres (PSQL), Oracle, etc.)
  - SQL is for *relational databases*

### Rails vs SQL

Anything Rails can do with our data models, SQL can do natively, because *secretly*, our Rails app is calling SQL for us under the hood!

You can see SQL being performed by your rails app in the log lines that print in the Rails console.

#### Create a table

##### Rails

```ruby
# db/migrate/20250319234716_create_posts.rb

class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    create_table :posts do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :body
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

##### SQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
    title TEXT
    body TEXT
    updated_at DATETIME
    created_at DATETIME
);
```

#### Create records

##### Rails

```ruby
Post.create!(title: 'This is a Title', body: 'This is a body')
```

##### SQL

```sql
INSERT INTO posts ("title", "body", "updated_at", "created_at") VALUES ('This is a Title', 'This is a body', '2025-03-19 00:00:00', '2025-03-19 00:00:00');
```

#### Update records

##### Rails

```ruby
comment = Comment.first
comment.update!(post_id: 2)
```

##### SQL

```sql
UPDATE "comments" SET "post_id" = 2, "updated_at" = '2025-03-20 00:20:56.993542' WHERE "comments"."id" = 1;
```
